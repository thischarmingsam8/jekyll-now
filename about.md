I'm a full-stack web developer from Southsea, who most notably made it to the front page of Codepen for my [simple responsive timeline.](http://codepen.io/thischarmingsam/details/wGGGby/)

After six years on the road as an 'interactive producer' making interactive displays for events, a chance meeting with the CEO led to me creating a mobile/desktop app that propelled me into the R&D department and a switch from Actionscript to the world of HTML/Javascript/CSS.

I took to Javascript and CSS straight away, learning every shiny framework I could get my hands on and applying what I learnt to a variety of real-time web applications. The applications were all based on .net MVC, giving me exposure to the serious world of back-end development and the very clever engineers that were developing them.

The company I was working for was bought out, which moved me onto a long-term project heading up the front-end development of the new company's main web platform. This brought with it an emphasis on CSS and Javascript at scale, working with a remote team that needed a consistent set of components to work with.

Via the magic of Linkedin I was given the opportunity to work for a creative agency. Unfortunately it closed its doors a year and a half after I joined, but in the time I was there I worked on some incredible projects alongside some more very clever people. I shifted between hybrid mobile / desktop applications, .net MVC web applications and sites built by hand and by Wordpress. This started a love affair with PHP, a refreshing change to the strictness of .net MVC and easily accessible as a newbie to the language.

After finding myself time on my hands I decided to put my newly-learnt PHP skills to good use and start a passion project: An English fantasy football site, but based on American fantasy football rules. Currently in it's fifth season, it remains the cause of most arguments in my friendship group. Screenshots on [my homepage](http://thischarmingsam.co.uk/#projects). 

I had a brief stint with a design agency creating custom CMS', Wordpress sites and web applications, but the commute took its toll and I moved to a position closer to home. I then worked on PHP e-commerce sites: more CSS at scale and very clever people with a deep knowledge of the internals of PHP.

I'm currently heading up the front-end development of a location analytics start-up, having been given the chance to get my head around Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

Congratulations for making it this far! I hope my articles are interesting and/or helpful, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
